# UnityXRGrabAndClimb
This Unity project is a very simple XR interactions tech example that implements grabbing and climbing using Unity's multiplatform APIs.

Unity version 2018.3.0f2

This project targets "roomscale" VR.  As such, it meant to be experienced on a HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or Windows Mixed Reality Immersive headset.  It should also work on any other roomscale headset that is supported by one of those SDKs in the future.
