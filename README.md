# UnityXRGrabAndClimb
This Unity project is a very simple XR interactions example that implements grabbing and climbing using Unity's multiplatform APIs.

Unity version 2018.3.0f2

This project targets "roomscale" VR.  As such, it meant to be experienced on a HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or Windows Mixed Reality Immersive headset.  It should also work on any other roomscale headset that is supported by one of those SDKs in the future.
