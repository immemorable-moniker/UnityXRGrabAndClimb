# UnityXRGrabAndClimb
This Unity project is a very simple XR interactions tech example that implements grabbing and climbing using Unity's multiplatform APIs.  It's not super clean, but it does showcase a fully physics-based XR Rig.

Unity version 2019.2.0f1

This project targets "roomscale" VR.  As such, it meant to be experienced on a HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, or Windows Mixed Reality Immersive headset.  It should also work on any other roomscale headset that is supported by one of those SDKs in the future.
